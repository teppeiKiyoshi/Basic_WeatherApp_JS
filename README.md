# Basic_WeatherApp_JS
This project was developed using Javasript and an API, Open Weather using city names and via geolocation.

### Basic Use
This was intended to showcase and demonstrate the developer's skill in dealing with Javascript with APIs. It was deployed to github pages but cannot be accessed as I did hide the API Key for security purposes. However, if you wish to check it out, you can reach me out through my email to supply your concerns.
